Objective: To learn about the attitudes and practices of Nigerian researchers towards open science.

Your Tasks: In this questionnaire, you will be asked to respond to open science-related questions in your own situation. We will provide a detailed explanation of the questions and answers within the introduction of each chapter.

Time Required: This questionnaire includes a number of extended questions, and you will be required to answer a maximum of 37 questions, with a response time of approximately 10-15 minutes.

Risk: There are no foreseeable risks of participating in this investigation, but you may feel tired or bored due to the volume of the questionnaire. If you feel uncomfortable or offended by some of the questions, you are free to give up answering the questionnaire.

Benefits: Your participation will greatly improve our awareness of Open Science development in China and Nigeria, and this questionnaire will help you gain more knowledge of Open Science.

In addition, for every valid piece of data, we will donate RMB 0.5 to Tencent Public Welfare's Rural Youth Depression Assistance Program.","Disclosure of Informed Consent:

    This questionnaire will be answered by you, so you are the owner of this data. We plan to upload the data from this study to a web-based public database and make it fully public. This aims to maximise the use of public funds so that other researchers may not have to spend resources to collect similar data. This will also maximise your contribution to scientific research and human society.

    Note that disclosure of the data from this questionnaire means that the information you provide may be used in other future research projects that may or may not be related to the topic of this study.

    We will ensure that the public data does not contain your name or any information that can be traced back to you. To protect your privacy, we will also treat other potentially sensitive information confidentially, ensuring that no one who knows you can deduce your identity from this data.",Which of the following research practices do you know about?
